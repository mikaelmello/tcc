Elastic optical networks are currently considered one of the best solutions in regards to handling the increasing global data traffic, providing several benefits compared to traditional alternatives. The flexibility in resources allocation allows it to be done in an adaptable and efficient manner. However, traditional resource allocation algorithms are not appropriate for a flexible scenario, resulting in several studies aiming to develop new allocation strategies. Because of the complexity of elastic optical networks, these studies often use simulations to validate their results. Recently, the use of machine learning as a tool for the development of strategies has been growing, although simulators currently found in the literature do not have support for using machine learning models in their implementations. This work presents a qualitative and quantitative analysis of popular machine learning libraries in the literature in order to define directions and recommendations for future implementations, and contributes to the \acrfull{ONS} by implementing features supporting the use of machine learning models in simulations.
