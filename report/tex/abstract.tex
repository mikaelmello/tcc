Researchers are increasingly studying the applications of machine learning (ML) in Elastic Optical Networks (EONs). However, existing EON simulators do not currently support the integration of ML models in their simulations. This work presents a qualitative and quantitative analysis of popular ML libraries aiming to define directions and recommendations for future implementations, and a contribution to the Optical Network Simulator (ONS) implementing initial features to support the use of ML models.
