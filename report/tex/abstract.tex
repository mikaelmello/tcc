Elastic optical networks are currently considered one of the best solutions to handle the increasing global data traffic, providing several benefits compared to traditional alternatives. The flexibility in resources allocation allows it to be done in an adaptable and efficient manner. However, traditional resource allocation algorithms are not appropriate for a flexible scenario, resulting in several studies with the goal to develop new allocation strategies, and because of the complexity of elastic optical networks, these studies often use simulations to validate their results. Recently, the use of machine learning as a tool for the development of strategies has been growing, although simulators currently found in the literature do not have support for using machine learning models in their implementations. This work presents a qualitative and quantitative analysis of popular ML libraries in the literature in order to define directions and recommendations for future implementations, besides contributing to the Optical Network Simulator (ONS) with an initial implementation of features that support the use of machine learning models in simulations.
